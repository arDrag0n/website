## The Problem
Televisions were simple back in the day, you just pressed a button and a channel played. If you want to watch your sfavourite show, you would have to wait for its time slot and watch it with ads. Now Television have been transformed into "SmartTV". It can do a lot more than display your traditional display but at the same time it has also become a lot slow and expensive. It is going backwards now. It is full of Ads and Laggy UI.
### Gaslighting of Tech Companies
We have been lead to believe that electronics of today need more powerful chips than we have today. In reality, this is _only partialy true_. The chips of recent years are powerful enough to last almost 7-8 years. You can optimize your electronic device removing bloat and can make some general light tasks as much fast as a new machine. More powerful chip is not such a big problem. The big problem is Bloated UI and software experience. This is also the reason that custom roms are faster than the stock ROM because there are trackers and useless apps present in stock rom that takes up space and use that precious memory and CPU power. 
## My Solution
There can be two solutions to this problem
1. Debloating SmartTV
2. Making Your own SmartTV
### Debloating Smart TV
You can debloat your Smart TV by:
1. Rooting (May Void Warranty But a thorough debloat process)
2. Using Adb or a frontend for this process such as [Universal Android Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater)
### Making Your Own Smart Tv
Displays are way Cheaper than than SmartTVs and they can be converted into smart TVs by attaching Raspberry Pi or similar Mini PC.
Options are limitless here. You can Browse internet, install any app you want, Transform it into your Home Cinema, Connect it to your server and stream content,etc. If you want to explore this option further. I recommend this youtube video form [Jeff Greeling](https://youtu.be/-epPf7D8oMk?si=a-CuvzJ0teLIrajl)

## Conclusion
You can optimize your TV more by debloating it or make your own one with only the services you actually need. It will be way faster, cheaper and better than your current Smart TV experience.
