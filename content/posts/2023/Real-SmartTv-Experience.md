## The Problem
Televisions were simple back in the day, you just pressed a button and a channel played. If you want to watch your sfavourite show, you would have to wait for its time slot and watch it with ads. Now Television have been transformed into "SmartTV". It can do a lot more than display your traditional display but at the same time it has also become a lot slow and expensive.
