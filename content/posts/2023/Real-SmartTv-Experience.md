## The Problem
Televisions started as an easy to use device, you just pressed a button, and a channel played. Now-a-days, Television has been transformed into “SmartTV” Full of Ads, Tracking Built-In (as a feature btw) and Bloated UI
## Optimizing Electronics
The reason TVs feel bloated and laggy is because the tech companies just bundle the TV with a bunch of bloat that uses more resources than necessary. You can optimize your electronic device by removing bloat and can make your TV somewhat useable. Bloat takes up space and use that precious memory and CPU power.
## My Solution
There can be two solutions to this problem
* Debloating SmartTV
* Making Your Own SmartTV
### Debloating Smart TV
You can debloat your Smart TV by:
* Rooting (May Void Warranty But a thorough debloat process)
* Using Adb or a frontend for this process such as [Universal Android Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater)
### Making Your Own Smart TV
Displays are way Cheaper than than SmartTVs and they can be converted into smart TVs by attaching Raspberry Pi or a similar Mini PC. Options are limitless here. You can Browse the internet, install any app you want, Transform it into your Home Cinema, Connect it to your server, stream content, etc. If you want to explore this option further. I recommend this YouTube video from [Jeff Greeling](https://youtu.be/-epPf7D8oMk?si=a-CuvzJ0teLIrajl)
## Conclusion
You can optimize your TV more by debloating it or make your own one with only the services you need. It will be way faster, cheaper, and better than your current Smart TV experience.
