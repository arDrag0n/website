## The Problem
Televisions were simple back in the day, you just pressed a button, and a channel played. Now Television has been transformed into “SmartTV”. It can do a lot more than display your traditional display but at the same time, it has also become a lot slower and expensive. It is full of Ads and Laggy UI.
## Gaslighting of Tech Companies
We have been led to believe that the electronics of today need more powerful chips than we have today. In reality, the tech companies just bundle a bunch of bloat which uses more resources than necessary. The chips of recent years are powerful enough to last almost 7-8 years. You can optimize your electronic device by removing bloat and can make some general light tasks as fast as a new machine. A more powerful chip is not a problem for the time being. The big problem is the Bloated UI and software experience. This is also the reason that Custom ROMs are faster than Stock ROMs because there are trackers and useless apps present in Stock ROMs that take up space and use that precious memory and CPU power.
## My Solution
There can be two solutions to this problem
* Debloating SmartTV
* Making Your Own SmartTV
### Debloating Smart TV
You can debloat your Smart TV by:
* Rooting (May Void Warranty But a thorough debloat process)
* Using Adb or a frontend for this process such as [Universal Android Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater)
### Making Your Own Smart TV
Displays are way Cheaper than than SmartTVs and they can be converted into smart TVs by attaching Raspberry Pi or a similar Mini PC. Options are limitless here. You can Browse the internet, install any app you want, Transform it into your Home Cinema, Connect it to your server, stream content, etc. If you want to explore this option further. I recommend this YouTube video from [Jeff Greeling](https://youtu.be/-epPf7D8oMk?si=a-CuvzJ0teLIrajl)
## Conclusion
You can optimize your TV more by debloating it or make your own one with only the services you need. It will be way faster, cheaper, and better than your current Smart TV experience.
