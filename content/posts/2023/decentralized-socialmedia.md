Social Media has changed drastically over the years. Only a few years back, the internet wasn’t this bad. Nowadays, Social Media Companies change their policies every full moon. In this messy age of technology, it might be better to use decentralized social media. Decentralized social media apps and websites are gaining traction especially because of recent policy changes of social media apps such as Reddit and Twitter. Last Year, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk and he changed the API policies and raised API prices, shutting off every third-party app. Similarly, Reddit also increased its API prices, and now users are furious. Decentralized Social Media such as Mastodon, Lemmy, and Kbin are now gaining popularity.
## Advantages
- Decentralized Social Media is not controlled by one single company or person rather you can make your own instance of social media and interact with others. Thus, you cannot be banned from such a platform.
- Decentralized Social Media is also harder to fully ban in a country because there are so many instances. If one instance is banned, you can use another.
- If you don’t like the policies of one instance you can choose a different instance of your liking.
## Disadvantages
- The main disadvantage of something like Lemmy is that it is harder to moderate because of bot accounts. But by using identification measures such as captchas, they can be reduced.
- Fewer Users are present on these platforms.
But by overcoming these hurdles, decentralized social media can become mainstream.
